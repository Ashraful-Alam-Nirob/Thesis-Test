# Thesis-Test
 
1. As mentioned in the original repo, to run the project, we need to run python main.py --dataset=amazon
2. As we currently facing resource problem, we run it on colab with few changes.
3. To run in colab :
   a. Upload repo in colab\n
   b. mount drive on colab
   c. then run the !python /content/drive/MyDrive/KDD2022CLARE-master/main.py --dataset=amazon
   d. made some changes in the original code. Basically changed the folder directory to drive directory and worked properly.
